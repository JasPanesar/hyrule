About Hyrule
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyrule is a validation framework for ColdFusion. Contrary to popular belief it's not just for ORM (Hibernate) based applications. The Hyrule framework will work with ColdFusion 9+ applications that use a model driven behavior for business objects. All this means is that use a class (component) to describe your objects such as user, person or employee.

This framework gives you multiple ways to declare your validation rules or as the framework refers to them, constraints. Once you have defined your constraints you can pass in an object to the framework and it will let you know if it passes validation. This approach gives you a simple way to perform data validation in your object oriented based applications.

This framework was created because there was a real need for it. When I started building most of my applications in a model driven form it became clear that there had to be an easier way of validating data. My inspiration was and still is the Hibernate Validator project from the Java community. This project also wouldn't be where it is today without the help of some amazing people.
