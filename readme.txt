Hyrule Validation Framework
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Data validation has always been a one of those repetitive processes that I always wanted to standardize. 
	With that I set out to create a framework that would make data validation simple, fun and very flexible. 
	Enter Hyrule, a framework that will create a consistent and easy to use validation layer in your next 
	project.

Hyrule Validation Process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1.) Create a component with properties
	2.) Add validation rules to the class using one of our many methods
	3.) Create an instance of Hyrule
	4.) Pass your component into Hyrule's validate() method and receive a result
	5.) Check to see if your object passed validation and if it did not get a list of errors that were found

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	ColdFusion 9
	

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- drop the Hyrule folder in your webroot (per server installation) 
	  OR 
	  drop the Hyrule folder in your project (per project installation)

	- In the project that you wish to use Hyrule create a mapping /hyrule that points to the hyrule folder.
