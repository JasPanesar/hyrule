					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hyrule is a validation framework for ColdFusion. Contrary to what people think is not just for ORM (Hibernate) based applications. The Hyrule framework will work with ColdFusion 9+ applications that use a model driven behavior for business objects. All this means is that use a class (component) to describe your objects such as user, person or employee.</p>
					<p>This framework gives you multiple ways to declare your validation rules or as the framework refers to them, constraints. Once you have defined your constraints you can pass in an object to the framework and it will let you know if it passes validation.</p>
					<p>This framework was created because there was a real need for it. When I started building most of my applications in a model driven form it became clear that this was something I needed.  My inspiration was and still is the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/validator.html" target="_blank">Hibernate Validator</a> project from the Java community.  This project also wouldnâ€™t be where it is today without the help of some amazing people. In no particular order they are:</p>

						<li>Aaron Greenlee</li>
