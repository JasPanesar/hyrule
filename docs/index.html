					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hyrule is a validation framework for ColdFusion. Contrary to what people think is not just for ORM (Hibernate) based applications. The Hyrule framework will work with ColdFusion 9+ applications that use a model driven behavior for business objects. All this means is that use a class (component) to describe your objects such as user, person or employee.</p>
					<p>This framework gives you multiple ways to declare your validation rules or as the framework refers to them, constraints. Once you have defined your constraints you can pass in an object to the framework and it will let you know if it passes validation.</p>
					<p>This framework was created because there was a real need for it. When I started building most of my applications in a model driven form it became clear that this was something I needed.  My inspiration was and still is the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/validator.html" target="_blank">Hibernate Validator</a> project from the Java community.  This project also wouldn't be where it is today without the help of some amazing people. In no particular order they are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Aaron Greenlee</li>
						<li>Lance Staples</li>
						<li>Tony Nelson</li>
						<li>Luis Majano</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>ColdFusion 9</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Installation</h2>
					<p>The easiest way to get started is to drop the entire Hyrule folder into your web root. If you can't do this you also have the option of dropping it anywhere on your server and creating a /hyrule mapping that points to that folder.  When you open you the folder you should see the following directory structure.</p> 
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Docs:</strong> This folder contains all documentation created for Hyrule.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Samples:</strong> This folder contains samples that allow you to browse the features of the framework and see source code examples.
							<ul>
								<li><strong>annotation:</strong> An example of how to declare your constraints using property annotations.</li>
								<li><strong>basicorm:</strong> How to use the framework in a basic ORM enabled application.</li>
								<li><strong>complete:</strong> A single template that displays a form. When you save the form the object is validated and if errors exist they are displayed to the user.</li>
								<li><strong>constraints:</strong> An example of declaring constraints using the constraints struct. It also shows off an example of inhertance with this approach.</li>
								<li><strong>context:</strong> An example of passing a list of properties to validate. This is helpful when you don't want to validate the entire object.</li>
								<li><strong>context_property:</strong> An example of setting a context name when you only need to validate certain properties.</li>
								<li><strong>custom:</strong> An example of a custom validator. If the framework is missing a constraint you can create your own.</li>
								<li><strong>frameworks:</strong> Full featured examples using the frameworks Coldbox,FW/1 and ColdMVC.</li>
								<li><strong>property:</strong> An example of declaring constraints at the property level.</li>
								<li><strong>rb:</strong> An example of how to use Internationalization and Localization in your application.</li>
								<li><strong>tagbased:</strong> An example that shows declaring constraints in tag based components.</li>								
							</ul>
						</li>			
						<li>
							<strong>System:</strong> This folder contains the core framework code and should not be modified.
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>core</strong>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>constraint:</strong> The validation constraints</li>
										<li><strong>i18n:</strong> Internationalization and localization component.</li>
										<li><strong>result:</strong> The result object is what is passed back during validation.</li>
										<li><strong>rule:</strong> Rule and rule set logic</li>
										<li><strong>ruleParser:</strong> The different rule parsers</li>
										<li><strong>Hyrule.cfc</strong> The frameworks main component</li>
										<li><strong>Settings.cfc</strong> The frameworks settings handler</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li><strong>i18n</strong> Contains the default properties file for displaying error messages.</li>
								<li><strong>tags</strong> Not being used at this time</li>
							</ul>	
						</li>
						<li><strong>Test:</strong>  This folder contains all of the MxUnit test cases for the frameworks constraints.</li>
